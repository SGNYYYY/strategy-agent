**Analysis Task:**
The price has reached your key level. You must validate the signal using Real-time Data and Order Book (Quote Data).

1. **Quote Data Analysis**: Look at the Bid/Ask queues. Is there significant selling pressure (large Asks) capping the price? Or buying support?
2. **False Breakout Check**: If this is a BUY signal (breakout), is the price holding above the level? Or did it just touch and reject?
3. **Stop Loss/Take Profit**: If evaluating a sell, prioritize capital preservation. If the trend is broken, confirm the exit.
